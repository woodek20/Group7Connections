# Final Problem Set
## Connections Game


### Authors:
_Anabelle Hessong, Elise Wood, Kyra Powell_


### Project Description:
_In the game of connections, the user is presented with 16 words, each of which belong to one of four, themed categories. The user is tasked with entering the number of four words consecutively that they believe belong within the same category._


_If the user guesses four words correctly, the game will print the category name. The user has not won the game until all four categories are found. There are unlimited attempts._


_If the user enters an invalid number, they will have the opportunity to input a number again._


### Instructions:
_Users should enter the numbers of four words that they believe belong to the same category until they correctly guess all four categories. To play again, rerun the code and four new categories will appear._


### Limitations:
_In the New York Times original game of Connections, the user is able to click on the words belonging to a category and they will move together if correct. This was not modeled within this code. Also, there is a limitation of 18 possible categories as they were hardcoded. The New York Times game also tells users when their guess is “one away” or when they have three out of the four words correct. We did not do this in our code. Additionally, if the user inputs something that is not an integer, there will be an error and the game will stop running. However, if they input a number outside of the desired range, they will be able to repeat._


### Breakdown of effort
Kyra – I worked in class discussing the logic of our code. Then met outside of class with Elise and we worked together to write the client code. Consulted about the other code. I also worked on the readme file explaining the instructions and limitations of the game. I definitely participated in this project but honestly, both Elise and Anabelle did much more work than I did as they had a better understanding of the skills needed for our game.




Anabelle – I was unable to attend the group meeting outside of class but spent multiple hours working independently on the project. I created the methods for randomly selecting categories, randomly organizing the 16 words, tracking where the words within a category had been placed, and determining when a correct guess was made by the user. I spent time working with Elise to debug this final method. I also helped with the structuring of the while loop to determine when the game was over after all four categories were found.


Elise – I met outside of class and worked independently on the project. I created the header and closing method, created the Client while loop to ask for and receive user inputs, edited the format of how the 16 words were printed, added the code to repeat the words after wins,added the comments and instructions throughout the code, and created the readme file. Additional time was spent trying to fix the checkWins method to track which category the user’s chosen word belonged to, but this was ultimately solved by Anabelle. I fixed an error that was preventing the first category from being selected.
